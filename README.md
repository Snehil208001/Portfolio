## üìñ About Me

Hello! I'm **Snehil**, an Android App Developer passionate about creating dynamic, user-friendly mobile applications. I graduated from Bharati Vidyapeeth College of Engineering Deemed University, Pune. I love building intuitive experiences and am always eager to learn new technologies. When I'm not coding, I enjoy playing the guitar, singing, and cooking.
